# Forecasting-Carbon-Market-Prices-with-Bayesian-and-Machine-Learning-Methods
Forecasted Carbon Market returns with LSTM models in Python and shrinkage time varying parameter models in R. 

In this repository you can find the code and the data I used for my thesis "Forecasting Carbon Market Prices with Bayesian and Machine Learning Methods". I am glad about any feedback in general and are particulary interested in improving the performance of shrinkageTVP models or the LSTM model in python. My project is rather resource heavy due to forecasting more than 100 tismes in the future (1-step ahead and 4-step ahead forecasts) but I provided an intro model in each case to not use up too much time and still be able to judge model performance.
